    jan 16 - 70% / jan 22 91% accuracy 
    look at week 4-5 week website: https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet
alexnet : 60% accuracy : Gluon .ai model zoo >> clasifcation 
    what did they brought to the table ? accuracy (veritcal)/ sample # (horizontal)

ppt AlexNet (slide 41)
    2012: error rate 15% AlexNet
    2013: error rate 13%  Zfnet
    batch normalization / resizual normalization 
    MPL - layer normalization 
    restnet : verital / horizontal - /depth of layer / 
    channels per layers ex: rbg / channel correspond to the filters 
    convoluational layers
        layer will have a lot of channels 
        1024 channels then produce 1024 values then scale it (filters), usually don't scale up because 1 is the largest so that 1 is the most important feature 
        the most important channels / filters are choosen 

    2017 : transformers , don't need to have so many layers / but want to be wide 

another paper 16 by 16, batches ? generative models : use CCN / convoluational layers / most generative models use transformers and conluvion - call it diffusion models 
deep learning : responsible for all the AI boom 
questions: opimization, prepared with questions / working with colab /
